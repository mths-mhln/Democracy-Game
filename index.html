                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">The thunderous applause echoes through the Great Assembly Hall as you take the oath of office. You are now Prime Minister of the Republic of Civitas—a nation of 10 million citizens emerging from decades of authoritarian rule. The people have placed their hopes in you to build something unprecedented for them: a lasting democracy.</p>
                    
		    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">But democracy is not a destination—it's a daily choice. Around you, the forces of history watch and wait. Military generals who remember the "efficiency" of the old regime. Economic elites worried about their privileges. Social movements demanding immediate change. Foreign powers with their own agendas. The international community, hopeful yet skeptical.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px">Your every decision can send ripples through five critical pillars of democratic governance: <strong>Public Trust</strong> in your leadership, <strong>Economic Prosperity</strong> that legitimizes the system, <strong>Social Cohesion</strong> that binds citizens together, <strong>Institutional Strength</strong> that outlasts any single leader, and <strong>Military Loyalty</strong> to civilian authority.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px"><strong>Tread carefully:</strong> History is littered with democracies that crumbled under the weight of poor decisions. Will you be remembered as the architect of a thriving republic, or as the leader who let freedom slip away? The choice—and the responsibility—are yours.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>2. The Importance of Legitimacy:</strong> Governments must maintain public trust and deliver results to survive.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: ${resultColor}; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Key Lessons About Democracy:</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>1. Balancing Competing Voices:</strong> Democracy requires leaders to navigate between different groups who all deserve to be heard, even when their demands conflict.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>2. No Perfect Solutions:</strong> Democratic governance means choosing between imperfect options where someone will always be disappointed.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>3. Representation vs. Effectiveness:</strong> Including everyone's voice can slow decision-making, but excluding voices undermines democratic legitimacy.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>4. Long-term vs. Short-term Thinking:</strong> Democratic leaders must balance immediate public demands with long-term consequences that may not be popular.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>5. The Price of Compromise:</strong> Democratic solutions often require everyone to give up something, making compromise both essential and politically costly.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>6. Institutional Constraints:</strong> Democratic institutions both limit and protect leaders, creating stability but sometimes preventing quick action.</p>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: ${resultColor}; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Reflection Questions:</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">• When did you feel most torn between what different groups wanted?</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">• Which decisions forced you to disappoint supporters for the greater good?</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">• How did competing demands shape your leadership style?</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">• What does this reveal about why democratic governance is inherently difficult?</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">• How might different democratic systems change how leaders balance these pressures?</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">• When is it worth disappointing some groups to protect democratic principles?</p>
